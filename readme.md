<b> ProfileWise </b>

Overview: ProfileWise is a people-profile web application which can be plugged in to any sector with statistical parameters associated with people. ProfileWise can be leveraged for getting a holistic view of the profile parameters in the form of multi-level data grids, chart representations etc. ProfileWise is a configurable product, the core concept is based on the Supervisor-Reporteeâ€™s relation with respect to the statistical parameters.

Use Case: In the current Educational system, students mark details are entered in the progress cards which will be referred by the HOD or parents to get an overall view. Imagine, if these data can be visualized in such a way that the Supervisor (HOD) or parents gets an in-depth analysis in a well-organized and representational manner. ProfileWise performs this data aggregation and visualization. This is an entirely configurable system where the Supervisor can define the fields for adding the data records. For example, a field set can be created for Class 10th Subjects and this set can be used for all the respective students for adding data into it. Subjects are different for other classes, where a new field set can be configured. Likewise, this can be plugged in to any sector where there are measurable parameters associated with People.
